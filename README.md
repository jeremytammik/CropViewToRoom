# CropViewToRoom

Revit C# .NET add-in that, for each level, collects all rooms and generates views cropped to each room, to address
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) threads
on [generating views from rooms](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/generate-views-from-rooms/m-p/9144449)
and [CreateViaOffset](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/createviaoffset/m-p/9159500).

Some important additional aspects of determining and the required outer room outline geometry are addressed by
the [ElementOutline companion add-in](https://github.com/jeremytammik/ElementOutline).
